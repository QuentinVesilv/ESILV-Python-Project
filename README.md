## The DataSet
Dataset by Mark Blair, Joe Thompson, Andrew Henrey and Bille Chen created in September 2013.

StarCraft is a game used a lot in reinforcement learning because it require a lot of micromanagement processing. This dataset could be interesting in this way to train different reinforcement learning algorithm (which we will not see here but this data set probably has been create in this way).

This dataset concerns the game StarCraft 2. It lists 20 metrics for around 3400 players about different informations about the way they play.

The dataset contains the LeagueIndex of the players, this will be our research value. Depending on the other attribute the objective will be to find the LeagueIndex of the player.


## Conclusion
With a maximum accuracy of 47% we can not say that the research was a success. The great search allows us to find a way bigger accuracy.

One of the reasons is the poor quantity of data. There are only around 3 thousands data which is not a lot. 

Another reason is that the different variables correlate with the LeagueIndex were also correlate a lot with each other.

However, this project was interesting because it allows us to test different models and algorithms on a true database.
